It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\n",

I couldn't believe the staff was allowing this to happen. They were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted (in vain) to quiet them. You'd think the mom would leave at this point with her  kids....um...no....the staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing. Then....it happened...she said \" you guys better behave or mommy will be fired\"!! Holy shit....she works there!! Even worse! Shame on that owner for allowing this to happen.

The chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs, that make your body parts\"romantic\" when you think of their cookies.. BTW 5:30pm, on a Tuesday, when we left, a 30 minute wait..
